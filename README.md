# Indeed-Web-Scraper
Python implementation to scrape job postings from Indeed. 

Main version includes the most up-to-date version of the program. Built for automation and utilizes Selenium to retrieve data instead of BeautifulSoup. Also includes usage of SQL. Also includes a custom bullt api contained in app.py using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

Master branch contains another modified, outdated version of scraper for PC. Built more for user input. Some features include multithreading to scrape data from multiple pages at once, advanced search to filter specific jobs, and exporting of retrieved data to various file types.
