# Indeed-Web-Scraper
Python implementation to scrape job postings from Indeed. 

v2(Automation+SQL) branch includes the most up-to-date version of the program. Built for automation and utilizes Selenium to retrieve data instead of BeautifulSoup. Also includes usage of SQL.

Main version currently supports base functionality to scrape data from Indeed utilizing user prompts via console. Works on both PC and Android platforms.

Master branch contains another modified, outdated version of scraper for PC. Built more for user input. Some features include multithreading to scrape data from multiple pages at once, advanced search to filter specific jobs, and exporting of retrieved data to various file types. This version cannot be used on Android since Android does not support multithreading.
