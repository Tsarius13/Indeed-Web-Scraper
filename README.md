# Indeed-Web-Scraper
Python implementation to scrape job postings from Indeed. 

Main version includes the most up-to-date version of the program. Built for automation and utilizes Selenium to retrieve data instead of BeautifulSoup. Deposits retrieved postings into both .csv files and a MySQL database. 
This version also includes a custom bullt api contained in app.py using Flask and SQLAlchemy. Contains basic CRUD functions.

Master branch contains another modified, outdated version of scraper for PC. Built more for user input. Some features include multithreading to scrape data from multiple pages at once, advanced search to filter specific jobs, and exporting of retrieved data to various file types.
