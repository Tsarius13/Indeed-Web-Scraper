# Indeed-Web-Scraper
Python implementation to scrape job postings from Indeed. 

Main version currently supports base functionality to scrape data from Indeed utilizing user prompts via console. Works on both PC and Android platforms.

Master branch contains most up-to-date version of scraper for PC. Some features include multithreading to scrape data from multiple pages at once, advanced search to
filter specific jobs, and exporting of retrieved data to various file types. This version cannot be used on Android since Android does not support multithreading.

Future plans include:
Creating a UI to replace the usage of user prompts and generate a better experience for users

Scripting the program to run off command lines

Packaging program into an executable once above tasks are completed

Optimizing an Android specific version and possibly creating an app around it

Add additional functionality to scrape data from other job sites like LinkedIn, Monster, etc. (if possible, and only ones that use HTML ONLY)
